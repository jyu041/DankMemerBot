# DankMemerBot

This is a small automation bot that helps you do some currency commands while you are not present infront of your computer, for example you were to go and take a big poop, you may use this tool to make sure you get the few extra bucks in Discord. 
I will **not** be responsible for any account bans, money lost, it is all the end-user's repsonsibility for any damage caused. This is just a testing tool that should never be used.

# Some instructions
This tool was designed for users with monitor sizes of 1920x1080, and have discord maximized on that resolution by pressing the small square in the app, but other users don't worry, you may adjust the resolution and stuff within the code, where I have placed some instructions there as well. 
This tool uses pixel accuracy clicks and functions, so make sure you get the pixel right when entering the coordinates in the code. 

# Requirements
The requirement for this tool aint that crazy, you just need the following modules where most of them are already installed with python:
- random
- time
- pyperclip
- pyautogui

# Some Info
So how does this tool work? It basicly emulates clicks and keyboard inputs into discord. And it copies text from the output of "Dank Memer", generates an output from it, and makes you get money. If you AFK with this tool, for like on whole night (like 8 hours), you are likely to earn up ot 40000 coins. 
It runs the beg, search(scout) and guess commands to earn the coins, and stores them automatically within your bank using the "pls dep all" command, but becareful, users with small banks might lose money in their wallet as search(scout) could kill you, even it has got a small change.
